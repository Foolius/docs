# Core, `|` ("bar")

Core twigs are flow twigs.  The compiler essentially pins a Nock
formula, or battery of formulas, to the subject.

All `|` twigs are macros around `$core`. (See the `$core`
section in [`span`](../../basic#-core-p-span-q-map-term-span) above.)
`$core` uses the subject as the payload of a battery, whose arms are
compiled with the core itself as the subject.
